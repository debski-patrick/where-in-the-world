### What I learned

This challenge was a great learning opportunity. I worked on different topics that helped me improve my knowledge of technologies such as React, Tailwind, Fetch and of course JS.

I also added some new features like the theme switch button or the path handling, for the latter I initially thought to use React Router but due to some changes of ideas React Router was no longer necessary so I decided to do the path handling with vanilla JS.
